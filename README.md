This repo contains solutions to lab questions that have been covered in the course and my class (Lab Group B01). Of course, solutions will only be released once covered in class.

Solutions labelled "-Setter" were written by the question setters themselves.

Solutions labelled "-Fred" were written by myself.

Solution styles are good to follow. Please by mindful that modularity, appropriate variable naming, comments such as pre/post conditions are not always present.
